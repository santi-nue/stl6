# Automated Linear Regression with Streamlit

I built an application using Streamlit which creates a linear regression model automatically by verifying the assumptions and performing statistical tests. The user needs to provide numerical independent variables data in a CSV or Excel format and the application will handle the rest of the process, making it a simple and time-efficient solution for creating a linear regression model and removing the need for extensive statistical knowledge. My application can be found on this [link](https://darren7753-automated-linear-regression-streamlit-app-i2szem.streamlit.app/).
